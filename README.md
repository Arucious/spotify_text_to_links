# What is this? 
You have a list of songs for the wedding. Your DJ says he wants all the spotify links instead. What a drab. Get your spotify credentials and feed in a list of songs with a song on every newline, and this will spit you out a csv with some relevant information 
# How do I use it?
1. Get your spotify developer credentials - specifically your client ID and client secret.
2. Add these to an environment variables file (.env) at the root of the repo directory. It is expecting CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET.
3. Grab a list of songs as a csv, every song on a new line.
4. Run the script
5. Scowl at the DJ
